        header field can be used by user agents to
        indicate the set of natural languages that are preferred in the
        response.  Language tags are defined in RFC 5646. If none of the 
        languages given are supported, a default language will be returned.

        The <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233#section-3.1">Range</a>
        header field on a request modifies the method semantics to request
        transfer of only one or more subranges of the selected representation
        data, rather than the entire selected representation data.

        The Range unit `bytes` is supported to represent byte ranges of the
        page or document of the specific rendition's content. 

        For the cases where the Range header is omitted, the full document or page will be 
        returned.

        header field can be used by consumers to specify response media types
        that are preferred.

        Upon receiving this header the server will use <a

        Content Negotiation</a> to determine the "best guess" format for the
        consumer.

        In cases where the underlying resource can not be returned as a
        requested format, the server may make a determination of which format
        of the content will be returned.

        In cases where the Accept header is omitted or has the value `*/*`, the
        server will make a determination of which format of the content will
        be returned.

        Consumers should inspect the `Content-Type` response header to determine
        the actual format of the content returned.

        header field makes the request method conditional on
        the recipient origin server either having at least one current
        representation of the target resource, when the field-value is "*",
