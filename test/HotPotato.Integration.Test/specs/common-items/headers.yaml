    Access-Control-Expose-Headers:
      description: |-
        The Access-Control-Expose-Headers
        response header indicates which headers can be exposed as part of the
        response by listing their names.

        Browsers and libraries that participate in the CORS standards will
        restrict access to non-simple headers.

    Access-Control-Allow-Origin:
      description: |-
        The Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header is returned after a
        successful `CORS` preflight request to indicate whether the target
        resource can be shared with the given `Origin`.

    Access-Control-Max-Age:
      description: |-
        The Access-Control-Max-Age response header indicates how long in seconds
        the results of a `CORS` preflight request can be cached.

    Content-Language:
      description: |-
        The Content-Language header field describes the natural language(s)
        of the intended audience for the representation.  Note that this
        might not be equivalent to all the languages used within the
        representation.

        type: string
      example: 'en'
    Location:
      description: |-
        The "Location" header field is used in some responses to refer to a
        specific resource in relation to the response.  The type of
        relationship is defined by the combination of request method and
        status code semantics.
        Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.2
      schema:
        type: string
      example: 'http://www.example.net/index.html'
    Content-Range:
      description: |-
        The Content-Range header field is sent in a single part 206 (Partial
        Content) response to indicate the partial range of the selected
        representation enclosed as the message payload, sent in each part of a
        multipart 206 response to indicate the range enclosed within each body
        part, and sent in 416 (Range Not Satisfiable) responses to provide
        information about the selected representation.
        Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233#section-4.2

      example: 'bytes 1-1000/3000'
    Accept-Ranges:
      description: |-
        The Accept-Ranges header field allows a server to indicate that it
        supports range requests for the target resource.
