    <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-nottingham-atompub-fiql-00.txt">FIQL</a> query
    describing a list of work items to retrieve the list of ad hoc and system tasks for.

    If an ad hoc task has filter rules configured, then they will be evaluated and tasks that
    do not meet the filter rules conditions will not be returned.

    An example of specifying document id 101 and 102
    ```
    (type==document;id==101),(type==document;id==102)
    ```

    An example of specifying a WorkView object id 101 and 102 in class 201
    ```
    (type==workview;classid==201;id==101),(type==workview;classid==201;id==101)
    ```

    Only the equals operator will be supported, submitting a query with any other
    operator will result in a 400 Bad Request response.
