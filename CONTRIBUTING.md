# Contributing

We invite all Hylanders to contribute to our repositories. We ask that any change be discussed via a [Jira Issue](), [Mattermost](), via [Email](), or in person. When preparing a contribution to our repository, please consider the following contribution guidelines.

## Code of Conduct

## Testing

We are the automated test team, so we expect all pull requests to have some amount of automated testing. Moreso, we have begun moving all of our newer repositories to a trunk based branching model, so it is imperitive that all changes be appropriately and completely tested before merging into master. Any pull request without automated tests may be declined immediately.

## Pull requests

When coding and testing is complete, a pull request can be created to merge
